## Notes from Stand-up meeting (Class Activity)
Other Student in discussions: Francis and Arpit

## Key Points
1. Technical interview should not simply a leetcode style coding question because it cannot measure the qualities for a good engineer. Instead it can be something like project based interview
2. Performance assessment should not only assess regarding technical contributions does the software engineer do, but it should also explicitly assess some teamwork quality, such as how well the person work in a team
